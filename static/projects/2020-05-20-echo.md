    After I started feeling confident with my React and Redux skills, I had
    decided to make some kind of a big personal project to put myself on test. I
    always loved music streaming apps like Spotify and Deezer but I also had a
    huge prefrence to the way Soundcloud translated the songs into visual waves
    in their players' UI. Now with that idea in mind I had to search for an API
    that will provide me with the songs and also find somekind of solution to
    transform the songs into visual waves in the player section.


    After some digging in Rapidapi website I discovered Deezer API for developers, signed up for my developer account and registred my app to get my API keys secondly I went to search in Google and Github for a solution to transform the songs into visual waves, and after few minutes I discovered this amazing library called WavesurferJS. 


    After Setting the main UI components of Echo, I decided to use Redux-thunk middlewear to populate the state with the data coming from the api, and also developing the architecture of my reducers and providers wich I already designed.\

    With all that finshed Echo was quite complete so, I implemented WavesurferJs and created solutions to some rerendering problems the app had, added Firebase as a solution for my backend and deployment needs, and finnaly implemented Pose animation library to make the visuals more appealling.
